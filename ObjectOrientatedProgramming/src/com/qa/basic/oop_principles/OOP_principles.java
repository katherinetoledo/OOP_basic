	/* Within Java OOP (Object Orientated Programming) there are some key principles
	 * These are things you should be doing for "Best Practice":
	 * 
	 * - Abstraction: Only what MUST be visible to children / objects should be shown. 
	 * 		Abstracting methods and variables and ONLY SHOWING the BARE MINIMUM
	 * 		Multiple abstract classes to give groups of functionality
	 * 
	 * - Encapsulation: Data should be bundled together within itself, and should only be accessible in a limited fashion.
	 * 		Nothing should have DIRECT ACCESS to data, but should use methods, but should use mthods to get limited access to data
	 * 		cake1.colour is not a good and secure why to encapsulate
	 * 
	 * - Inheritance: Data can be inherited (passed down) from its parent class using the EXTEND key word.
	 * 		Creating a class with some methods, another class EXTENDS from it adding new methods BUT using the original
	 * 
	 * - Polymorphism: WHat objects / fields does an object belong to
	 * 		What objects are this object a child of, all objects can belong to multiple forms
	 * 		super(); --> constructor object
	 *
